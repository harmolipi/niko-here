This is my personal website, blog, and portfolio. I've created it in order to:

1. Keep myself accountable with my various side-projects
2. Track my learnings, in case they end up being useful for others

I'm building it with NextJS, because it really provides a nice and opinionated
structure to React, with some incredibly smart defaults baked in, which make
for a solid starting point - especially for a simple static site.

I'll be adding features as I think of them, and in all likelihood, this
site will become a playground for new ideas, techniques, and tools
as I learn about them.
