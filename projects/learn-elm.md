I really like everything I've seen and heard about [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)
so far, and I'd love to learn it.

Cons:

- Don't know when I'd ever work somewhere where I can use it
- It's only a frontend language, and if I learned it, I feel like I'd miss it
  on the backend

Pros:

- Fully functional
- Incredibly helpful error messages from the compiler
- Seems like it makes refactoring fun and easy
- Much less risk of unknowingly introducing breaking changes
- Think I can apply much of what I learn about its structure and architecture in
  the languages I do actually use regularly

Hopefully I'll get the chance to dive in and learn it soon!
