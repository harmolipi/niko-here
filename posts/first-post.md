Welcome to my new blog!

I hadn't planned to start a blog until recently, but decided to go for it for 2 reasons:

1. I need to keep myself accountable with this long list of incomplete side-projects
2. I keep learning cool things, and I feel like I need to write them down - both for myself, and for anyone else that might end up trying to figure them out

This blog is currently just the result of the NextJS blog tutorial, but it will grow into a more full-fledged personal site. I just thought that the tutorial was a good way to both learn the basics of NextJS, and have a decent starting point to work from

Eventually I'll add features like an RSS feed, but we're not there yet. For now, just check back every now and then!
